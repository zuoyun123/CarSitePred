This MATLAB software package is used to predict carbonylated sites in human proteins.

Usage of this MATLAB software package:

(1) Prepare your sequence(s) file in fasta format and name it “example.txt”;
(2) Run the program “sliding.m” to intercept the peptide fragment of length 21, and save the intercepted fragment in the testD.txt;
(3)"testD.txt" into the testsample folder, and "Text Output Image.py"  into the same directory, run "Text Output Image.py" , you can output "testD.txt" in  the testsample folder in the directory line by line into a picture.
(4)Follow the link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/18EPyHu0uvWrMp5H2PsdoyQ , and extract code：jum1  to download modelK.m, modelP.m, modelR.m, and modelT.m
(5) Run the program “test.m”to get the test results.

Please note:
(1) this software package only supports the 64-bit version of Windows operating system.
(2) The version of Python and libraries used by "Text Output Image.py":
- Python version used by the code: This code should be compatible with your version of Python, Python 3.x is recommended (e.g. Python 3.7 or later).
